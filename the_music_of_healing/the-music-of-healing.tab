[Verse 1]

  C                   F             C
Don't beat drum that frightens the children,
                            G
don't sing the songs about winning and losing,
  C                       F                 C
sit down beside me, the green fields are bleeding.
                      G
sing me the music of healing.

[Verse 2]

  C                  F      C
Sing me a song of a lover returning,
                                       G
the darker the night, the nearer the morning,
   C           Am        F             C
bring me the news of a new day that’s dawning,
 C                    G C
sing me the music of healing.


[Chorus]

G   G7          F      G       G        G7       F        C
Ah, ah, the heart’s a wonder, stronger than the guns or thunder,
  C              F    C         G        G7   C
even when we're torn asunder, love will come again.

[Verse 3]

   C                          F             C
Sometimes the truth's like a hare in the cornfield,
                                    G
you know that it's there, but you can't put your arms round it.
 C                      F          C
All we can hope for is follow it's footprints,
                      G
sing me the music of healing.

[Verse 4]

   C                            F         C
Who would have thought I could feel so contented
                            G
to learn I was wrong after all of my rambles !
 C                  Am             F             C
I've learned to be hard and I've learned how to tremble,
 C                    G C
sing me the music of healing.


[Chorus]

G   G7        F        G       G        G7       F       C
Ah, ah, the heart’s a wonder, stronger than the guns or thunder,
  C              F    C         G        G7   C
even when we're torn asunder, love will come again.

[Verse 5]

 C                   F               C
Somehow the cycle of vengeance keeps turning,
                              G
till each other's sorrow and songs we start learning.
   C                    F             C
Peace is the prize for those who are daring,
                      G
sing me the music of healing.

[Verse 6]

 C                       F             C
Time is your friend, it cures all your sorrows,
                         G
but how can I wait till another tomorrow ?
   C       Am         F            C
One step today and a thousand will follow,
 C                    G C
sing me the music of healing.


[Chorus]

G   G7        F        G       G        G7       F       C
Ah, ah, the heart’s a wonder, stronger than the guns or thunder,
  C              F    C         G        G7   C
even when we're torn asunder, love will come again.
